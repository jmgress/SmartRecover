# Quizly Documentation Review Instructions

When using the chat feature or reviewing documentation:
- Always check that documentation matches the actual code execution and current implementation.
- Validate that API, configuration, and workflow docs reflect the latest code and endpoints.
- Flag any outdated, missing, or incorrect documentation and suggest updates.
- Ensure code comments, README files, and guides are consistent with backend, frontend, and test logic.
- For new features or changes, update documentation immediately to prevent drift.
- Use examples from the codebase to clarify usage and integration points.
- Reference key files: `README.md`, `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md`, `docs/AI_TEST_FIX.md`, backend and frontend API docs.

_If documentation is unclear, incomplete, or out of sync, request clarification or propose improvements._
